				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>
					During the first half of the semester, we focused on basic networking principles to prepare you to understand the attacks and defenses prevalent in cybersecurity.   Now, we're turning our attention to particular attacks and defense techniques.  Since our textbook is primarly a networking text, in this half of the course, we will rely largely on a number of high-quality instructional videos from ProfessorMesser.com to cover the basic material. We will continue to have readings from the textbook, but they will be shorter than in the first half of the semester.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the [transcript] below, I introduce this second half of the semester.
				</p>

				<div id="video_transcript"> <!--make this a mouse-over or pop-up or something...?-->

				<p>
					Welcome to part 2 of Cybersecurity Fundamentals. Now you have the networking background you’ll need to understand the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the methods that we use to protect the Internet and individual computers.
				</p>

			<p>
				Let's turn our attention to cybersecurity topics. We’ll start with a high-level look at cryptography. I assume that you’re either taking or will take the separate Cryptography course, so the goal here is just to introduce you to terminology and basic concepts. Next, we’ll look at general types of cyber attacks and then attacks on specific applications and services, such as the web and DNS. In the last three modules, we’ll discuss different ways to protect the Internet infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection services, network access control, and transport layer and network layer security measures.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this half of the course, we will still have readings from the textbook, but they will be much shorter than in the first half of the course. To supplement, I have included links to a number of high-quality instructional videos, so make sure to leave time to watch them as you do the readings.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we've been doing previously, each module will begin on a Monday when the course readings, homework assignment, and discussion questions will be available on the PLE. By Wednesday evening, you should have done enough of the reading to respond to the discussion questions. By Sunday night, you should have submitted replies to your classmates’ discussion posts and submitted the homework assignment. Use the Hallway forum to ask questions or send me an email if you need to discuss a private matter.
			</p>

			<p>
				Remember to pay attention to the learning check questions. You’ll likely see some of these again on the Final Exam.

	<div class="intro">
	<!--Module 10.1-->

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
			Cryptography is all about encoding a message in such a way that only the intended recipient can decipher the original message.  There are two basic parts to cryptography: a cryptography algorithm, or cipher, and a key.  The key and the original message are the inputs to the cipher and the encrypted message, or ciphertext, is the output.
		</p>

		<p>
			A cipher should be designed so that without the key, it should be very difficult to decrypt the message. Before computers, ciphers could be relatively simple because it would take humans an enormous amount of time to brute-force and try all of the different combinations of a key.  But, with today’s powerful computers, we have to be careful about the ciphers that we employ to ensure that they cannot be easily broken.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two basic types of ciphers, block ciphers and stream ciphers.  Block ciphers operate on a set (or block) of symbols of fixed size.  Stream ciphers operate on a continuous stream of symbols.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ciphers can also be categorized based on how many keys they use. A symmetric key cipher uses a single key that is used for both encrypting and decrypting.  An asymmetric key cipher uses one key for encrypting and a different, but related, key for decrypting.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this module, we will look at symmetric key ciphers and how they are used in wireless LAN security, and asymmetric key ciphers and how they are used in the public key infrastructure.

	<div class="symmetric_key_encryption">
	<!--Module 10.2-->
		<p>
			Here we're looking at symmetric encryption ciphers, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two broad classes of symmetric key encryption techniques, stream ciphers and block ciphers. The video below gives a brief overview of each. For the rest of this topic, we'll focus on block ciphers. We'll discuss stream ciphers later when we look at wireless security.

			<em id="video_quote">“Some data transfer methods will encrypt data one byte at a time or in groups of larger data blocks. In this video, you’ll learn how block ciphers combine data encryption with speed and efficiency.”</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			Block ciphers operate on fixed-size blocks of data.  So, the data to be encrypted is first divided into fixed-sized blocks (usually either of size 64 bits or 128 bits).  As in the figure below, the symmetric key and the block of plaintext are sent as input to the block cipher encryption function.  The output is the ciphertext for that block.  This process is repeated until the entire plaintext data has been encrypted.  The most commonly-used block ciphers are 3DES and AES.

	<div class="public_key_encryption">
	<!--Module 10.3-->

		<p>
			This topic starts our look at asymmetric encryption, or public key cryptography.
		</p>

		<p>
			Watch these two videos for an intro to symmetric vs. asymmetric (video 1) and public and private keys (video 2). <!--Insert videos-->
		</p>

		<p>
			<em id="video_quote">“Our encryption methods will generally use either symmetric encryption or asymmetric encryption, and sometimes both! In this video, you’ll learn the advantages and disadvantages when using symmetric or asymmetric encryption types.”</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em id="video_quote">“Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys to provide a secure channel. In this video, you’ll learn how public keys and private keys can be used to encrypt data, create digital signatures, and create a secure symmetric key.”</em>
		</p>

		<div id="public_key_example">
			<p>
				Here’s another way to look at this.  Assume that Alice and Bob each have a public key and private key (how they are obtained will be discussed later).  We will use the following notations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>KA+ – Alice’s public key</li>
    			<li>KA- – Alice’s private key</li>
    			<li>KB+ – Bob’s public key</li>
    			<li>KB- – Bob’s private key</li>
    		</ul>

    		<p>
    			Now, if Alice wants to send an encrypted message, m, to Bob, she uses Bob’s public key and sends K B + (m) to Bob.  (How Alice gets Bob’s public key and how she knows that it’s Bob’s public key will also be discussed later.)  This message can only be decrypted with Bob’s private key.
    		</p>

			<p>
				To decrypt the message, Bob applies his private key to what Alice sent:
			</p>

			<p>
				KB- (KB+(m)) = m
			</p>

			<p>
				This operation also works in reverse.  If Alice applies her private key to a message, anyone can decipher the ciphertext, but only with Alice's public key.
			</p>

			<p>
				Alice: sends KA- (m)
				Bob: m = KA+(KA-(m))
			</p>

			<p>
				Now if anyone can decipher the message, what good is that?  Think about it, and we'll cover it later in this module.
			</p>

		</div>
	</div> <!--public key encryption-->

	<div class="rsa">
	<!--Module 10.4-->
		<p>As seen previously, the idea behind public key cryptography is that you have a public key and a private key. These keys have a special relationship.  Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.  Anything encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted by the corresponding public key.</p>

		<p>RSA is an algorithm for generating and using these special private and public keys.</p>

		<p>RSA public key cryptography consists of three parts: 1) key generation, 2) encryption, and 3) decryption</p>

		<h3>Key Generation</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Choose two large prime numbers, p and q, which you keep secret</li>
			<li>n = p * q</li>
			<li>z = (p-1)(q-1) – note that z is also called Φ(n)</li>
			<li>Generate your public key</li>
			<ul>
				<li>choose a number e < n that is relatively prime to z (meaning that e and z have no common factors, other than 1)</li>
    			<li>public key, K+ = (n, e)</li>
    		</ul>
    		<li>Generate your private key</li>
    		<ul>
    			<li>find the number d such that ed-1 is exactly divisible by z (or put another way, ed mod z = 1)</li>
    			<li>private key, K- = (n, d)</li>
    		</ul>
       	</ul>


    	<h3>Encryption/Decryption</h3>

    	<ul>
    		<li>Encrypt a message m: ciphertext c = me mod n</li>
    		<li>Decrypt a ciphertext c: m = cd mod n</li>
    	</ul>

		<p>The first video shows the inventors of RSA briefly explaining the algorithm.</p>

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b57zGAkNKIc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>The second video is a longer explanation of the RSA algorithm and the math behind it.</p>

		<p><em id="video_quote">"RSA Public Key Encryption Algorithm (cryptography). How & why it works. Introduces Euler's Theorem, Euler's Phi function, prime factorization, modular exponentiation & time complexity."</em></p>

		<p>Optional: See http://www.cem.me/pki/ for several posters that illustrate some of the details of using RSA and other cryptographic functions in SSL/TLS certificates.</p>

		<h3>RSA Calculator</h3>

		<p>Experiment with different values of p, q, K, e, and d at the RSA calculator at https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html.  Recall that p and q should be prime numbers. You can find a list of prime numbers between 0-10,000 at http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/prime-numbers-to-10k.html.</p>

		<p>For example, here's what I did:</p>

		<p>p 17</p>

		<p>q 11</p>

		<p>Click the Set p, q button, and the next boxes (N, r, Candidates) are filled in.</p>

		<p>N = 187, r = 160</p>

		<p>Pick a number from the Candidates box (numbers that are equal to 1 mod r) and enter it as K.  I chose 161.</p>

		<p>Click the Factor K button, and the factors of K box is filled in.  If the box says that K is prime or there are more than 2 factors, choose another Candidate.</p>

		<p>factors of K: 7*23</p>

		<p>Enter the two numbers from the factors of K list into e and d.  Then click the Check e & d button to determine if they are acceptable (e * d = 1 mod r).  If e*d mod r != 1, then you need to go back and choose a new Candidate for K.  If none of the Candidates work, then you need to choose a new p and q.</p>

		<p>I used e = 7, d = 23.  Note that both e and d must be < r.</p>

		<p>Now it's time to write your message in numeric form in the Msg box. I'm going to encode 75.  Note that the message you encode has to be < N.</p>

		<p>Click Encode/Decode</p>

		<p>The Encrypted ciphertext is 114, and the Decrypted plaintext is 75.</p>

		<p>In this example, the public key is {7, 187}, consisting of the modulus (187) and the public exponent (7).  The private key is {23, 187}, consisting of the modulus (187) and the private exponent (23).</p>

		<p>In reality, a 2048-bit key size is often used.  This key size refers to the modulus value (N, or 187 in the previous example).</p>

		<p>The important thing is that is that although N may be publicly known, with a sufficiently large N, it becomes impossible in practice to factorize N and come up with the right e and d.</p>

	</div> <!--rsa-->

	<div class="message_integrity_and_digital_signatures">
	<!--Module 10.5-->
		<h3>Message Integrity Overview</h3>

		<p>If Bob receives a message that he believes is from Alice, he needs to verify:</p>

    	<ol>
    		<li>The message has not been modified on its way to Bob - integrity</li>
    		<li>The message was actually from Alice - authentication</li>
    	</ol>

		<p>First, let’s look at how we could address concern 1 (that the message hasn’t been modified).  This is the issue of message integrity.</p>

		<p>A hash function takes an input m and computes a fixed-size string H(m), known as a hash.  A cryptographic hash function also requires that it is infeasible to find any two different messages x and y such that H(x) = H(y), meaning that there are no hash collisions.</p>

		<p>Using a cryptographic hash function along with an authentication code can provide message integrity. Encryption doesn’t even need to be included.</p>

		<p>After doing the reading assignment in the textbook, read this recent article related to the security of SHA1, “SHA1 algorithm securing e-commerce and software could break by year’s end”, http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/sha1-crypto-algorithm-securing-internet-could-break-by-years-end/</p>

		<p>Optional: Here's a second article related to concerns about SHA-1 - "Why Google is Hurrying the Web to Kill SHA-1", https://konklone.com/post/why-google-is-hurrying-the-web-to-kill-sha-1</p>

		<p>We'll address the second concern (message is actually from Alice) later in this topic.</p>

		<h3>Digital Signatures Overview</h3>

		<p>Using our previous notation for public key encryption, let’s suppose that Alice wants Bob to be sure that she sent the message, i.e., to authenticate the message.  So, Alice uses her private key to digitally sign the message, and sends the following to Bob: KA-(m), m</p>

		<p>Why does Alice send the message in plain-text?  This allows Bob to apply Alice’s public key to retrieve the message and then compare it against the plain-text message that she sent.</p>

		<p>KA+ (KA-(m)) = m</p>

		<p>Now, anyone with Alice’s public key can open the signed message, so it’s essentially being sent in plain-text as well. All that Alice is doing here is proving to Bob (or anyone else who receives the message) that she actually sent the message.</p>

	<p>Remember that in public key cryptography, there’s a special relationship between the public key and the private key.  Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.  Anything encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted by the corresponding public key.</p>

	<p>Now, let's combine encryption with digital signatures.  Let's say that Alice wants to send a private message to Bob and ensure that Bob knows that it's really from Alice.</p>

	<p>Alice would first sign the message, using her private key (can only be decrypted with Alice's public key).  Then, she encrypts the signed message with Bob's public key (can only be decrypted with Bob's private key).</p>

	<p>So, Alice would send this to Bob: KB+ (KA-(m))</p>

	<p>To read the message, Bob would apply his private key and Alice's public key.</p>

	<p>KA+ (KB- (KB+ (KA-(m)))) = m</p>

	<p>So, the only way that someone could read the message would be to have both Bob's private key and Alice's public key.  Bob is ensured that the only way someone could send the message would be to have Bob's public key and Alice's private key.</p>

	<p>How does Bob know that what he has as Alice’s public key is really Alice’s public key?  That requires the use of a certificate authority, which will be covered later in this topic.</p>

	<h3>Public Key Certification</h3>

	<p>Here are 3 short videos providing an overview of digital certificates, Internet shipping, and the Public Key Infrastructure.</p>

	<p><em id="video_quote">“We rely on digital certificates for much of the encryption that we use over the Internet. In this video, you’ll learn about digital certificates and what information is contained in a digital certificate.”</em></p>

	<p>Watch this short video for an example of using public key cryptography for Internet shopping.</p>

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hd2kEJoQmOU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p><em id="video_quote">“If you have a large number of devices using a public key infrastructure, you’ll need a way to manage all of the keys in the infrastructure. In this video, you’ll learn about public key infrastructures and the key management lifecycle.”</em></p>

	<h3>Internet Shopping with Certificates</h3>

	<p>Let's look at an example. Alice is shopping from amazon.com.  Amazon has already obtained their certificate from Verisign:</p>

	<p>sigVerisign (“amazon.com”, K+amazon.com), K+amazon.com, “amazon.com”</p>

	<p>This certificate is sent to Alice.  To verify the certificate, Alice uses Verisign’s public key (which has been pre-loaded on her computer and browser) to open the signed part of the certificate.  Alice then compares the signed string “amazon.com” with the unsigned string that was sent (“amazon.com”) and compares the signed public key (K+amazon.com) with the unsigned public key that was sent (K+amazon.com).  If these match, then Alice knows that this is actually amazon.com’s public key.</p>

	<p>Now back to our example of Alice and Bob.  If Alice wants to digitally sign her message to Bob and prove to Bob that her public key really belongs to her, she would obtain a certificate from the CA and send that certificate along with her message to Bob.  Note that the CA has to be a trusted source.  Bob needs to have the CA’s public key (KCA+) and trust that it is valid.</p>

	<p>Alice sends the following message to Bob:</p>

	<p>m, KA-(m), KCA-(KA+, Alice’s ID info)</p>

	<p>This includes the plain-text message m, the digitally signed message KA-(m), and the certificate signed by the CA.</p>

	<p>First, Bob uses the CA’s public key to open the certificate.  Then, he uses Alice’s public key that was inside the certificate to check that the signed message is the same as the plain-text message.</p>

	</div> <!--message integrity and digital signatures-->

	<div class="securing_wireless_lans">
	<!--Module 10.6-->

	<p>This topic is broken into two main parts.  First we’ll look at stream ciphers in general, and then we’ll look at their applicability to wireless networks in the form of WEP, WPA, and WPA2.</p>

	<h3>Stream Ciphers</h3>

	<img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/9459/streamcipher.png">

	<p>In contrast to a block cipher, a stream cipher processes a message bit-by-bit, in a stream fashion.  Stream ciphers typically encrypt plaintext by XORing the data bit-by-bit with a keystream.</p>

	<p>The Rivest Cipher (RC4) is a byte-oriented stream cipher. RC4 uses a variable key size (40-256 bits) and was used in well-known protocols such as SSL/TLS, WEP, and WPA.  Unfortunately, RC4 has known problems and isn't commonly used anymore, in favor of the AES block cipher.</p>

 	<p><em id="video_quote">“The speed of symmetric encryption makes it a good choice for our high-speed networks. In this video, you’ll learn about RC4, DES, 3DES, AES, Blowfish, and Twofish.”</em></p>

 	<p>For a nice overview of RC4 and its vulnerabilities, read this blog post by Matthew Green: "Attack of the week: RC4 is kind of broken in TLS", March 2013, <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/attack-of-week-rc4-is-kind-of-broken-in.html"> http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/attack-of-week-rc4-is-kind-of-broken-in.html</a></p>

 	<h3>WEP, WPA, WPA2</h3>

 	<p>The "broadcast over the air" nature of wireless communications makes it even more important to use robust protocols for securing the communications. Transmissions from a wireless device can be captured by anyone within radio range.</p>

	<p>There have been a series of security protocols defined for wireless networks. IEEE 802.11 originally defined the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) algorithm, but that turned out to be quite weak.  Later the WiFi Alliance proposed Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) as a standard.  WPA eliminated most of the security vulnerabilities with WEP, but was just meant to be a short-term workaround.  The current standard for wireless security, outlined in IEEE 802.11i, is WPA2.</p>

	<p>Watch this video for an overview of the differences between WEP, WPA, and WPA2 techniques for WLAN security.</p>

	<p><em id="video_quote">“802.11 networks rely on encryption to ensure the security of all wireless traffic. In this video, you’ll learn about WEP and WPA encryption and the dangers of using the wrong encryption on your wireless network"</em></p>

	<p>The table below provides a comparison between WEP, WPA, and WPA2.</p>
