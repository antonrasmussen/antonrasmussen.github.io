			<p>Yo! Welcome to my new website. If history is any guide, I'll put a bunch of work into this bad boy and then just delete everything and shut it down within a few years.</p>
			<p>Hopefully that doesn't happen this time though...</p>
			<p>The thing is, having a website these days--especially for someone who is in the CS world--is crucial. In the 23 years that I have been building webpages I have gone through countless experiments. Yep, 23 years! Given that I've opted to employ the least modern type of webpage out there (really a matter of my own personal taste) one might be doubtful of my website building experience. Alas, I started my first HTML programming on GeoCities (only the older folks reading will remember that site) and have employed HTML as a regular part of my computer habits ever since. Since GeoCities I have employed the following technologies for various websites: Blogger, Weebly, Wix, Wordpress (both .org and .com), GoDaddy, HostGator, Ruby (and Rails), Google Pages, GitHub, and, most recently, Google Cloud.</p>
			<p>The goal of each of my websites has usually centered on documenting my own thoughts and experiences; however, I have put together sites for the purposes of content and affliate marketing, surveys, and--most commonly--as a way to host my writing portfolio.</p>
			<p>After running full speed ahead into studying computer science at University, I have finally decided that I need to maintain a stable website that will allow me to post both personal and professional content. More so than ever, therefore, I wanted to employ technology that would be easy to maintain, robust in its lifespan, and (again, personal preference) highly text based and "minimalist."</p>
			<p>The outcome is this website that you've stumbled upon (somehow). Whether you were directed here from one of my social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) or you were directed here from my University page (yay for redirects!); whether you have found me through my code on GitHub or will find my GitHub via this website, you are most certainly welcome to explore my connect, connect with me, and/or send me suggestions for articles.</p>
