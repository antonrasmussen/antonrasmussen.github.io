			<p>Welcome to my new website. If history is any guide, I'll put a bunch of work into this bad boy and then just delete everything and shut it down within a few years.</p>
			<p>Fortunately the stakes are higher this time... [please don't bother to comb through Google looking for my web-based tragedies; oh, they're there.]</p>
			<p>See, the thing is, having a website these days--especially for someone who is in the CS world--is crucial. In the 22 years I've been building webpages I have gone through countless experiments. It's finally time to end the experimentation and produce the product.</p>
			<p>Yep, 22 years of experiments! Given that I've opted to employ the least modern looking webpage out there (really a matter of my own personal taste) one might be doubtful of my website building experience. That's fair; but, to be sure, I started my first HTML programming on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a> and have employed HTML as a regular part of my computer habits ever since. Since GeoCities I have used these technologies for various websites over the years: 
				<a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a>, 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">Wordpress</a> (both .<a href="https://wordpress.org/">org</a> and .<a href="https://wordpress.com/">com</a>), 
				<a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> (and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>), 
				Google <a href="https://sites.google.com/">Sites</a>, 
				<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, 
				and, most recently, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Cloud</a>.</p>

			<p>The aim of each website was usually centered on documenting my own thoughts and experiences; however, I also put together sites for the purposes of content and affliate marketing, survey and statistical analysis, and as a way to host my writing portfolio.</p>
			<p>After running full speed ahead into studying computer science at <a href="https://www.odu.edu">University</a>, the need to maintain a stable website that will allow me to post professional content is greater than ever. So, the reason for such a basic looking website is purely one of function; i.e. I wanted to employ technology that would be easy to maintain, robust in its lifespan, and (again, personal preference) highly text-based and "minimalist."</p>
			<p>So yeah, welcome to my website. While you may have already known that I keep a nerdy (and overly personal) website at <a href ="http://antonrasmussen.com">antonrasmussen.com</a>, what you're getting here is (hopefully) a bit more <em>professional</em>. Whether you were directed here from one of my social media sites (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntonJRasmussen">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/antonrasmussen/">Pinterest	</a>, etc.) or you were directed here from my University <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~arasmuss/">page</a> (yay for redirects!); whether you have found me through my code on <a href="https://github.com/antonrasmussen">GitHub</a> or will find my GitHub via this website, you are most certainly welcome to explore my content, connect with me, and/or send me suggestions for articles.</p>

			<td>
			<p>Truth is, one of my main motivations for getting this site going is to have a permanant home for (professional) ranting about my experiences through higher education [both academically and administratively]. I've been a higher ed student since the fall of 2001 and am, therefore, about to enter my 16th year as a college student. In that time a lot has changed about me, about how higher ed institutions work, and about the world.</p>
			<p>Moreover, I think it's time to take the advice of books like the Millenial Game Plan.</p>
			<p>Some great quotes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K6KOK0K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00K6KOK0K&linkCode=as2&tag=prtrhseblu-20&linkId=b76f935a3acab45edef4a6534ee67c5e">Millennial Game Plan</a>:</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>"Embrace the craftsman mindset"</li>
			<li>"Ask, 'What can I offer the world?'"</li>
			<li>"Spend your time on work that will force you to stretch"</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, even though I may come across as a bit miffed or even angry at times, my goal is based in service. I don't appreciate lazy work and I want to ensure that whatever I produce isn't just for my own benefit.</p>

			<p>As bulleted above, the opinions on this website are entirely my own and do not represent the opinions of my friends, previous employers, previous colleges and universities, or anyone other than me.</p>
			<p>Just as I am a huge fan of the way <a href="https://theweek.com/">The Week</a> magazine pulls content from multiple and varied sources, my goal with this website is to try and be faithful to the multiople sides of any argument. Anyone who knows me personally knows I am keen to play Devil's Advocate and am quick to point out biases when I see them. I am also not shy to admit that I have my own biases. While I may try my hardest to be fair and impartial, I can guarantee that my biases will end up all over this website. That said, I love to communicate and would be more than happy to receive suggestions, arguments, or knowledge that I am way off base about something. Feel free to email me at the address provided below.</p>
			<p>Everything I know is the result of borrowing and sharing ideas from others. In effort to honor the necessity of standing on the shoulder's of giants, everything I produce on this site is free to share. Even so, I do try my hardest to acknowledge all sources that I reference and appreciate the idea of similar attribution</p>

			<tr><td><h2>How To Make a Website Like This</h2></td></tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Eventually I will post a video showing how to make a website like this...</p>
			<p>For now, however, I will touch briefly on what to do to make this site.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Get a GitHub account: <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a></li>
			<li>Learn some basic HTML: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css">Code Academy: Learn HTML</a></li>
			<li>Learn some basics of Git: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">Code Academy: Learn Git</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you've finished learning a bit of HTML and Git, it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out how to set up a website using GitHub <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a>.</p>
			<p>That's pretty much it. Yep, that easy. As you learn more HTML and CSS, and perhaps eventually enter the exciting (and vast) world of JavaScript, it won't take you very long to turn a basic text-based website like the one I've made and turn it into a highly stylized and mobile responsive website.</p>

			<p>If you made it to this point, please take another minute to send me an email to say hello, or add me on my social media accounts! I would love to begin dialog with likeminded individuals and quite look foward to hearing any thoughts or impressions on my website.</p>
