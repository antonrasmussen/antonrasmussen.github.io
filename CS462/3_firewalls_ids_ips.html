			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>
				This module looks at ways that devices can be used to protect a network.  We will look at firewalls that use packet filtering to deny malicious packets access to the network.  We will also look at more intelligent methods used by intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect malicious traffic.  These include statistical-based, expert-based, and signature-based methods for finding anomalous network traffic.

			<h3>Relevance</h3>
			<p>
				<p>Because we are under attack, network administrators need tools to help protect the network.&nbsp; Firewalls and IDS/IPS can be used to offer some amount of protection against malicious attackers.</p>

			<h2>Network Address Translation</h2>

			<p>Before we talk about firewalls and IDS/IPS, we need to discuss Network Address Translation (NAT).&nbsp; We mentioned NAT previously in the context of private addresses (see <a href="../../../modules/6/6/2" target="_blank">Module 6, Topic 6</a>&nbsp;for a review).&nbsp; NAT can be used to allow multiple hosts to share a single IP address.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Watch the narrated slideshow below (<a href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/courses/cs562/video-transcripts/Module13-01-notes.pdf" target="_blank">transcript</a>) for an overview of NAT.</p>


			<p>NAT is somewhat controversial because it changes IP addresses and port numbers (in network layer and transport layer headers).&nbsp; Remember that these headers are normally not modified by standard routers.</p>

			<p>We&apos;re discussing NAT here because it can function as a cheap firewall since private IPs are not addressable by outside hosts.</p>

			<p><strong>Reading Assignment: </strong>The subsection &quot;Network Address Translation (NAT)&quot; in Section 4.4.2 in the textbook</p>

			<h3>Learning Check</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>What is the purpose of NAT?</li>
				<li>What does the NAT translation table contain?</li>
				<li>Why does NAT need to modify the IP header?</li>
				<li>Why does NAT need to modify the transport layer (TCP or UDP) header?</li>
				<li>Name one objection or problem with NAT.</li>

			<h2>Firewalls</h2>
<p>Firewalls are devices that are used to block access to particular parts of a network.&nbsp; Firewalls typically operate using rules that can block particular types of traffic (black-list) or allow particular types of traffic (white-list).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firewalls have three main goals:</p>

<ol>
	<li>all traffic (from outside to inside and inside to outside) passes through the firewall</li>
	<li>only authorized traffic will be allowed to pass through the firewall</li>
	<li>the firewall is immune to penetration</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three main types of firewalls: traditional packet filters, stateful filters, and application gateways. Each of these will be covered on a separate page in this topic.</p>

<h3>Traditional (Stateless) Packet Filters</h3>

<p>A firewall performing traditional packet filtering will look at each packet separately to determine whether to allow it or block it.&nbsp; This means that the only information that can be used to make the determination is located in the packet header.&nbsp; The packet filter will look at the information available in the packet header and compare that to a set of rules that determine whether or not the packet should be allowed to pass into or out of the network.</p>

<p>Access control lists (ACL) provide the rules that a router/firewall should use when examining packets. Table 8.6 (pg. 734) in the textbook shows an example ACL for a router interface.&nbsp; ACL entries are processed in order from top to bottom.&nbsp; Note that the last row is <em>deny all</em>, so any packet that doesn&apos;t match any of the previous <em>allow</em> rows will be denied.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s look at the first rule:</p>

<p>allow&nbsp; 222.22/16&nbsp;outside of 222.22/16&nbsp;TCP&nbsp;&gt; 1023&nbsp;80&nbsp;any</p>

<p>This is saying that a packet with a source address inside 222.22/16 (which is the organization&apos;s CIDR address) destined for an IP outside of 222.22/16 (so, outside of the organization) using TCP with a source port &gt; 1023 (not a server port) and destination port 80 (default web port) with any TCP flag can be allowed.&nbsp; This allows packets from a web client inside the organization to be sent to a web server outside the organization.</p>

	<li>A firewall uses a specific set of rules to allow or deny traffic flows through the network. In this video, you&#x2019;ll learn about firewall rulebases and we&#x2019;ll examine a firewall rulebase for an Internet-facing web server.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Stateful Filtering</h3>

<p>Stateful filters are actually aware of active TCP connections and can improve upon the security provided by traditional stateless packet filters.</p>

<p>Watch this short video to get an overview of stateful firewalls and how they are an improvement over stateless firewalls.</p>

	<li>&#x201C;Today&apos;s security technologies use different techniques for allowing traffic flows through the network. In this video, you&apos;ll learn about firewall-based stateful inspection and how to perform simple packet filtering in other network devices.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Textbook note:</em>&nbsp;</strong>There are a couple of typos in the textbook explanation of Stateful Packet Filters on pg. 735.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The sentence beginning with &quot;Further suppose...&quot; should read &quot;Futher suppose that this packet has a destination port number 12543 and destination IP address 150.23.23.155.&quot;</li>
	<li>The sentence beginning with &quot;When this packet reaches...&quot; should point to Table 8.8, not Table 8.7.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application Gateways</h3>


<p>Application gateways act as a proxy between internal hosts and the public Internet.</p>

<p>An example of a proxy is a web proxy server. Recall in our discussion of web caches and proxy servers (see <a href="../../../modules/4/6/1" target="_blank">Module 4, Topic 6</a>)&nbsp;that a client connects to the proxy, and the proxy then connects to the destination. With a web proxy server, all client requests are sent directly to the proxy instead of the target web server.&nbsp; So, the client maintains a TCP connection with the proxy server, not the web server.&nbsp; Then, the proxy creates and maintains a TCP connection with the web server.&nbsp;Thus, there is never a direct TCP connection between the client and the web server.&nbsp; Everything goes through the proxy.</p>

<p>In the same way, with an application gateway, there is no direct connection between the client and the server, but the client has the illusion of connecting directly to the server.&nbsp; The client is connected to the proxy, and the proxy is connected to the server.&nbsp; For security, this allows the proxy to perform filtering before passing information between the client and server.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2>IDS/IPS</h2>

			<h3>IPS/IDS Overview</h3>

<p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic and can issue alerts if anomalous traffic is detected.&nbsp; And, as the name implies, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can be used to block certain types of traffic in order to prevent attacks.&nbsp; IDS/IPS systems are often used together and are positioned behind a firewall as a second line of defense.</p>

<p>Approaches for IDS/IPS can be classified generally as anomaly/behavior-based or signature-based.&nbsp; Anomaly-based systems know what normal traffic looks like and report whenever they see anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Signature-based systems rely on having a database of the type of traffic a particular attack has generated and comparing incoming traffic to the signature database.&nbsp; Since a previous instance must be observed, signature-based systems cannot detect zero-day attacks.</p>

<p>A honeypot is a system that it set up with the intent to attract attackers.&nbsp; It allows network administrators to collect information about attackers that can then be used to protect the real network.</p>
