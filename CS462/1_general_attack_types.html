			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>
				This module will cover several types of general cyber attacks.  This includes man in the middle attacks where an attacker will attempt to capture packets traveling through the network, denial of service attacks that attempt to prevent legitimate users from accessing a system, and phishing and spam attacks that attempt to obtain private information from users. We will also cover some defenses that can be used for email.
			</p>

		</div> <!--overview-->

		<div class="objectives">

			<p>
				At the end of this module, students will be able to:
			</p>

			<ul>

    			<li>Explain the man in the middle attack.</li>
    			<li>Describe denial of service attacks and explain why they can be so damaging.</li>
    			<li>Distinguish between the smurf attack, ping of death, SYN flood, and UDP flood DoS attacks.</li>
    			<li>Explain why port scanning is an effective tool for attackers.</li>
    			<li>Describe how SPF and DKIM can be used to improve email security.</li>
    			<li>Explain how PGP provides confidentiality for email.</li>

			<p>
				Attackers have lots of techniques that they can use to disrupt the legitimate use of the Internet. Knowing these techniques can help us to avoid the attacks and to develop appropriate defenses. Spam email and phishing techniques are a popular way for attackers to gain access to private information, often allowing them to perpetrate more attacks. Efforts to improve email security are essential in preventing some of these attacks.

					What are DDoS attacks? DDoS Explained, Sep&nbsp;2012<br />
					Radware<br />2:20
				</small>
			</p>

			<p>Here are brief descriptions of four different DDoS attack methods.&nbsp; (Note that these are DDoS attacks, so the attacker here is not just a single machine, but likely is a botnet.)&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Smurf attack</strong> &ndash; This attack uses ping (ICMP echo).&nbsp; When a host receives an ICMP echo request, it will respond with an ICMP echo reply.&nbsp; In this attack, the attackers issue an ICMP request to the broadcast address with a spoofed source IP address (the address of the target).&nbsp; All hosts in the network will then flood the target with ICMP replies.</p>

			<p><strong>Ping of death</strong> &ndash; This attack also uses ping (ICMP echo).&nbsp; In this case, the attacker will send a ping packet larger than the maximum IPv4 packet size (64KB), which could crash the target.&nbsp; Most systems have fixed this bug, so this attack is not very effective today.</p>

			<p><strong>SYN flood</strong> &ndash; In TCP, when a SYN packet is received (1st packet in connection setup), the receiver sets aside resources needed to handle the TCP connection (buffer space, socket, etc.).&nbsp; In this attack, the attacker will send many TCP SYN packets, but never complete the handshake (by responding to the receiver&rsquo;s SYN/ACK).&nbsp; This leaves many &ldquo;half-open&rdquo; connections on the receiver and can use up all of the receiver&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp; Legitimate connections will then not be able to be handled.</p>

			<p><em>Optional: </em>For more information on the SYN flood attack, see the &quot;Focus On Security&quot; highlight in the textbook in Section 3.5 (pg. 257 in 6th edition)</p>

			<p><strong>UDP flood</strong> &ndash; UDP has no flow control or congestion control.&nbsp; A sender can send out UDP packets as fast as its network connection will allow.&nbsp; Additionally, if a sender sends a UDP packet to a closed port, the receiver will respond with an ICMP Destination Unreachable message.&nbsp; So, an attacker could send a large number of UDP packets to random ports, forcing the target to use its resources sending ICMP Destination Unreachable messages.</p>

			<p>Watch this video for a more in-depth discussion of DoS attacks.</p>

			<p>Professor Messer, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/denial-of-service-attacks-2/" target="_blank">Denial of Service</a>&rdquo;, Sep 2014</p>

			<ul>		
				<li><a href="http://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/denial-of-service-attacks-2/" target="_blank">http://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/denial-of-service-attacks-2/</a></li>
				<li>Denial of service attacks are very difficult to defend against. In this video, you&rsquo;ll learn about denial of service attacks and you&rsquo;ll see how one of the first DoS attacks, the Smurf attack, was able to disrupt services on many networks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><em>Optional</em>: See this article about a recent DDoS attack that impacted several popular web services last year - &quot;Feedly, Evernote And Others Become Latest Victims Of DDoS Attacks&quot;,&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/feedly-evernote-and-others-become-latest-victims-of-ddos-attacks/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/feedly-evernote-and-others-become-latest-victims-of-ddos-attacks/</a></p>

			<p><em>Optional: </em>For more information on port scanning, see the &quot;Focus On Security&quot; highlight in the textbook in Section 3.2 (pg. 196 in 6th edition)</p>

			<p>To get a better idea of what actually happens during a DDoS attack, watch these two short videos.</p>

			<p>The first video shows a visualization of web-server access logs using the tool Logstalgia (<a href="http://logstalgia.io/" target="_blank">http://logstalgia.io/&#x200B;</a>). It depicts HTTP requests and HTTP responses in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">Pong-like</a> manner.&nbsp;Clients appear on the left side and requested files appear on the right side.&nbsp; HTTP requests are shown as colored balls that travel to the requested resource.&nbsp; Requests that are successful and result in a HTTP response of 200 OK are hit with the paddle, while others (e.g., 404 File Not Found) pass through.</p>

			<p><small>Website Access Log Visualization, Jan 2010<br>
			1:15</small></p>

			<p>The second video uses the same visualization, but it shows a DDoS attack, which occurred on April 23, 2013.&nbsp; The botnet was downloading the VLC package in a loop. The peak rate of the attack was 200 Gbps.</p>

			<p><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNjdBSoIa8k?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></p>

			<p><small>Visualization of a DDoS Attack on the VideoLAN downloads infrastructure, Apr 2013<br>
			0:29</small></p>

			<p>Although port scanning is not necessarily a DoS attack, it is a method that can be used to check for vulnerabilities.</p>

			<p>Recall that the transport layer uses port numbers to help identify the process where a packet should be delivered.&nbsp; Also recall that there are standard port numbers associated with well-known applications, for instance port 80 is HTTP, port 23 is the telnet protocol.&nbsp; (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers</a> for a list of well-known TCP and UDP port numbers.)</p>

			<p>If an attacker knows that a certain application has a vulnerability, they may use a port scanner to find computers that are running that application and listening for connections on a particular port.&nbsp; Once they find it, this computer may become the target for an attack.</p>

			<p>The nmap tool (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/" target="_blank">https://nmap.org/</a>) is a well-known port scanner, originally developed in 1997.&nbsp; Nmap is also used by security professionals to perform security audits on their systems.</p>

		<!--Module 11.3-->

			<h2>Phishing</h2>

			<p>Phishing attacks are used to obtain sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, passwords, by masquerading as a legitimate website or email.&nbsp; Often phishing emails and websites have mis-spellings or grammatical errors that give them away, but some are quite sophisticated and realistically copy the look and feel of a legitimate website.</p>

			<p>Watch this video for an overview of phishing.</p>

			<h2>Securing Email and Spam Defense</h2>
			
			<p>In this topic, we&apos;ll first look at techniques for securing email.&nbsp; The most-widely used techniques are PGP and S/MIME.&nbsp;<span>Then we&#x2019;ll look at techniques for detecting email spoofing, which can be used to prevent some forms of spam. We&#x2019;ll look at Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).</span></p>

			<p><strong>Reading Assignment:</strong> Section 8.5 &#x2013; &quot;Securing E-Mail&quot; in the textbook.</p>

			<p>In addition to the textbook reading assignment (which just covers PGP), we will look at a few related articles, which will be posted on the specific topic pages.</p>

			</ul>

			<p>Before we talk about specific techniques, let&#x2019;s look at the basic approach of securing email, as described in the textbook in Section 8.5.1.</p>

			<h3>Confidentiality</h3>

			<p>In Figure 8.19, Alice uses a symmetric session key K<sub>S</sub> to send a secret email to Bob.&nbsp; This is demonstrating <em>confidentiality</em>. Alice uses a symmetric key for encrypting the message because symmetric encryption is much faster and more efficient than asymmetric (public-key) encryption.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Alice picks a random symmetric session key K<sub>S</sub></li>
				<li>Alice encrypts the message m with the secret session key K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>S</sub> (m)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Alice encrypts the secret session key K<sub>S</sub> with Bob&#x2019;s public key
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup>(K<sub>S</sub>)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li>Alice concatenates the encrypted message and the encrypted symmetric key to form a package
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>S</sub> (m) + K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup> (K<sub>S</sub>)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Alice sends the package to Bob</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here, Alice is using the fast method to encrypt a potentially long message and the slower method to encrypt the shared key (which presumably is shorter than the email message).</p>

			<p>At the other end, Bob will decrypt the message.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bob de-concatenates the package into K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup> (K<sub>S</sub>) and K<sub>S</sub> (m)</li>
				<li>Bob applies his private key to the encrypted symmetric key
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>B</sub><sup>-</sup> (K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup> (K<sub>S</sub>)) = K<sub>S</sub></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li>Bob applies the symmetric key to the encrypted message
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>S</sub> (K<sub>S</sub> (m)) = m</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Authentication and Message Integrity</h3>

			<p>Now let&apos;s look at the scenario if Alice only wants to send an authenticated message to Bob.&nbsp; She doesn&#x2019;t care if everyone in the world reads the message, but she wants to make sure that Bob knows it&#x2019;s from Alice and that it hasn&#x2019;t been tampered with.</p>

			<p>This is the scenario shown in Figure 8.20, demonstrating <em>authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Alice applies a hash function H to her message m to generate the message digest
					<ul>
						<li>H(m)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li>Alice then signs this result with her private key K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> to create a signed message digest
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li>Alice concatenates the original unencrypted message m with the signed message digest to form a package
					<ul>
						<li>m + K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
	
				<li>Alice sends the package to Bob</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At the other end, Bob will verify that the message is from Alice and hasn&#x2019;t been modified.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bob de-concatenates the package into m and K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m))</li>
				<li>Bob applies Alice&#x2019;s public key to the signed message digest
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>A</sub><sup>+</sup> (K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m))) = H(m)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
	
				<li>Bob computes the hash of the message
					<ul>
						<li>H(m)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
	
				<li>Bob then compares the results
					<ul>
						<li>H(m) == H(m)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note that here Alice and Bob must agree on the hash function so that they will get the same answer.</p>

			<h3>Confidentiality, Authentication, and Integrity</h3>

			<p>Now, let&apos;s look at putting these all together.&nbsp; We will combine the procedures described above.&nbsp; Alice&#x2019;s procedure is shown in Figure 8.21.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Alice creates the preliminary package, which is the signed message digest concatenated with the unencrypted message m (same as in the authentication and integrity procedure)
					<ul>
						<li>m + K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Alice treats this package as a message to be encrypted.&nbsp; Alice encrypts the package with the session key K<sub>S</sub>
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>S</sub> (m + K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m)))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Alice encrypts the secret session key K<sub>S</sub> with Bob&#x2019;s public key
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup> (K<sub>S</sub>)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Alice concatenates these to form the package
					<ul>
						<li>K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup> ( K<sub>S</sub>) + K<sub>S</sub> (m + K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> (H(m)))</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Alice sends the package to Bob</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note that here, Alice uses public key cryptography twice (with her private key and with Bob&#x2019;s public key).</p>

			<p>This is the basic procedure for providing secure email.&nbsp; The remaining issue is in distributing and validating the public keys.&nbsp; Alice has to trust that Bob&#x2019;s public key is really his, and Bob has to trust that Alice&#x2019;s public key is really hers.&nbsp;</p>

			<h3>Secure Email (PGP and S/MIME)</h3>

			<p><em>Source: <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pgp.png">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pgp.png</a></em></p>

			<p>As we have seen, common techniques for securing email are based on the public key encryption techniques that we have discussed earlier. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) provides confidentiality by combining both symmetric and public key encryption, and can also use digital signatures for authentication.&nbsp; Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) provides confidentiality, along with authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.</p>

			<p>Watch the short video below from Lynda.com for a demo of installing one of the free PGP tools and generating your public/private keypair.</p>

			<p>Read the article below for some of the challenges to secure email.</p>

			<p>&#x201C;The Daunting Challenge of Secure E-mail&#x201D;, <em>The New Yorker</em>, Nov 2013, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-daunting-challenge-of-secure-e-mail" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-daunting-challenge-of-secure-e-mail</a></p>

			<p>Some of the problems cited are that people just don&#x2019;t know how to use the keys.&nbsp; There&#x2019;s one example that with PGP, some users emailed their private key to the recipient instead of the actual message.</p>

			<h3>Email Validation (DKIM and SPF)</h3>

			<p>Here we&apos;ll look a bit at email sender authentication.&nbsp; This helps legitimate senders prove that the email they are sending isn&#x2019;t spam.&nbsp; Spammers often use forged IP addresses, which allows them to hide and keep their actual locations secret.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>For a look back at spam, read this 2006 article from security expert Bruce Schneier, &#x201C;Why Spam Won&#x2019;t Go Away&#x201D;, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2006/12/why_spam_wont_go_awa.html" target="_blank">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2006/12/why_spam_wont_go_awa.html</a></p>

			<h3>DKIM</h3>

			<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows a domain (or email provider) to sign an email message and claim responsibility for it.&nbsp; The receiving email server can then verify the signature to ensure the validity of the sender. DKIM is transparent to the email user.</p>

			<p>Here&apos;s an example of how DKIM might be deployed.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A message is generated by a user and sent to the user&#x2019;s local mail server.</li>
				<li>The content of the email message, plus some of the email headers, is signed with the email provider&#x2019;s private key.</li>
				<li>The signed message is then sent through the Internet to the recipient&#x2019;s local mail server.</li>
				<li>The local mail server then retrieves the public key (using DNS) and verifies the signature.</li>
				<li>If the signature is verified, then the message is put in the recipient&#x2019;s mailbox.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SPF</h3>

			<p>The goal of Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is to prevent spammers from sending email with forged return IP addresses. In SPF, a domain would publish additional DNS resource records that identify the machines that are authorized to send email from that domain.&nbsp; A receiving mail server could check the DNS record to verify if the address in the MAIL-FROM header is valid.</p>

			<p>SPF is similar to DKIM, but SPF only validates the message headers (SMTP headers), not the message contents.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The advantage to SPF is that the illegitimate email can be detected before the entire message is downloaded.&nbsp;</p>
